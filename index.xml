      <description>This is probably my first real post to any blog anywhere! I wanted to keep it short and sweet, but I tend to go a little overboard when it comes to writing, so please bear with me (this pun made more sense when I thought I&amp;rsquo;d use Bear Blog for my host!).
I&amp;rsquo;m a graphics engineer who has spent most of his career in tech so far, where I had the convenient (but totally illegitimate) excuse of &amp;ldquo;the company doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow its employees to publish personal software projects online&amp;rdquo; to procrastinate on anything non-work related.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is probably my first real post to any blog anywhere! I wanted to keep it
short and sweet, but I tend to go a little overboard when it comes to writing,
so please bear with me (this pun made more sense when I thought I&rsquo;d use <a href="https://bearblog.dev">Bear
Blog</a> for my host!).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a graphics engineer who has spent most of his career in tech so far, where I
had the convenient (but totally illegitimate) excuse of &ldquo;the company doesn&rsquo;t
allow its employees to publish personal software projects online&rdquo; to
procrastinate on anything non-work related. But I recently made a big career
change over to the games industry, and I figured that now is a better time than
ever to break my laziness streak! So I hope to mostly talk about code projects
here, probably related to graphics and games, but one of the best parts of doing
something new is that you can go in any direction, and it will still feel new,
so who knows how this will turn out!</p>

<p>For this first post, I just want to talk about my process for picking a blog
host. <a href="https://calebbiasco.com">I already have a (soon-to-be-deprecated)
website</a>, but it was built for job hunting and with
much less of a minimalist streak than I have now, which is why I&rsquo;m looking for
greener pastures. Now, I&rsquo;m the type of person to indulge in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">&ldquo;analysis
paralysis&rdquo;</a> when it comes to
any decision that involves any sort of commitment whatsoever, so it should come
as no surprise that I opened about 20 tabs worth of webpages as soon as I
decided I wanted to write a blog. With my main interest being graphics, I&rsquo;ll
want a good way to integrate images, videos, and code into the posts, but as
with most software, the world is really our oyster when it comes to what&rsquo;s
possible.</p>
<p>I obviously didn&rsquo;t invent the idea of blogging about graphics stuff, so I
decided to take a look at a few examples that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed over the years to see
if any features from their websites stood out:</p>
<h2 id="bear-bloghttpsbearblogdev"><a href="https://bearblog.dev">Bear Blog</a></h2>
<p>Bear Blog is a super simplified blog host that focuses on its consistency and
robustness over feature richness or monetization. On top of that, Bear Blog has
qualities that made it a great &ldquo;low-commitment&rdquo; choice: it&rsquo;s free-ish and is
super easy to set up, it has all of the basic building blocks for cutting one&rsquo;s
teeth on blog writing, and it seems to follow some tenets that I personally
endorse, such as <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/building-software-to-last-forever/">building long-lasting
software</a>.</p>
<p>I actually gave this a try before going with my current host, mainly because of
the &ldquo;analysis paralysis&rdquo; topic. Of all of the things that I&rsquo;ve learned so far in
my career, one of the most important is the truth behind the word &ldquo;commitment&rdquo;.
There are times when committing to something legitimately deserves great
caution, but those things tend to be a bit obvious &ndash; for example, a work
contract. In 99% of the non-obvious cases though, the amount of effort needed to
undo a commitment is so low that it&rsquo;s not worth more than a minute of thought,
and &ldquo;which blog service should I use&rdquo; for sure fits into that bucket. And given
that I switched to another option within a week of choosing it, I&rsquo;d say that
wasn&rsquo;t a bad idea!</p>
<h2 id="the-ryg-blog-fabian-giesenhttpsfgiesenwordpresscom"><a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com">The ryg blog (Fabian Giesen)</a></h2>
<p>Fabian uses <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>, one of the old hats when it
comes to web hosting. I had the experience of working in WordPress about a
decade ago, and while I&rsquo;ll always be impressed by the sheer technical depth that
Fabian puts into his posts, I imagine he may still be dealing with the WYSIWYG
clunkiness that software from WordPress&rsquo;s era tends to carry with them. Aside
from that, it also has a pretty busy layout, and I&rsquo;m interested in being as
lightweight and to the point as I can manage.</p>
<h2 id="inigo-quilezs-bloghttpsiquilezlesorg"><a href="https://iquilezles.org">Inigo Quilez&rsquo;s blog</a></h2>
<p>Since Inigo has been a staple resource for graphics on the web for many years, I
imagine that his site has organically grown into what it is today. Considering
that it&rsquo;s more of an encyclopedia than a blog at this point, it makes sense that
it would be very customized (although aside from embedded
<a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">ShaderToy</a> programs, it&rsquo;s mostly just images and
Markdown). But my priorities are in getting my thoughts down on digital paper
and pushed out into the world, so I imagine I won&rsquo;t need the level of usability
that Inigo&rsquo;s site strives for.</p>
<h2 id="bartosz-ciechanowskis-bloghttpsciechanowski"><a href="https://ciechanow.ski/">Bartosz Ciechanowski&rsquo;s blog</a></h2>
<p>On the surface, Bartosz&rsquo;s website seems a little more cookie cutter than
Inigo&rsquo;s, looking like something you could get from any blog service. But as soon
as you dig into any of his posts, it&rsquo;s obvious that it may be the most high-tech
blog in existence! Even beyond the highly interactive and beautiful renderings,
his text styling and how it matches the illustrations is *<em>chef&rsquo;s kiss</em>*. I
frankly might send him an email just to ask if he uses any tools for
constructing his blog posts, or if it&rsquo;s by hand&hellip; In any case, while this feels
like a gold standard to aspire to, I also recognize that it requires an
extraordinary amount of experience and design expertise, so I think it&rsquo;s in my
better interest to opt for a more constrained blog service. At least for now.</p>
<h2 id="the-danger-zone-matt-pettineohttpstherealmjpgithubio"><a href="https://therealmjp.github.io/">The Danger Zone (Matt Pettineo)</a></h2>
<p>Matt uses a self-hosted <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> instance, with the
<a href="https://github.com/Track3/hermit">Hermit</a> style. The result is a super clean
and pretty lightweight site that is as customizable as anything else on the web,
even including <a href="https://therealmjp.github.io/posts/gpu-memory-pool/#cpu-write-performance">embedded
JavaScript</a>.
It also includes comments, which can be great for extending the discussion on
topics. However, a peek behind the curtain at his hosting repo reminded me of
exactly why I grew to dislike hosting my own website: CSS, yaml, doc generators,
HTML&hellip; But my previous experience with maintaining a self-hosted website may
allow me to avoid the biggest pitfalls with this option.</p>
<p>There were a couple others that I took a look at (<a href="https://www.jeremyong.com">Jeremy
Ong</a>, <a href="https://bartwronski.com">Bart Wronski</a>), but
they were mostly just different flavors of one of the options I listed above.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-went-with">What I went with</h2>
<p>If you happen to just read the footer of my website (unless I&rsquo;ve since changed
it), you&rsquo;ll notice that I went with Hugo. Ultimately, Bear Blog was just a bit
too limiting in its design for me, and the fact that I&rsquo;d have to pay a few bucks
to remove those limitations made it a bit more of a &ldquo;commitment&rdquo; in a sense.
Hugo, on the other hand, clearly shows a lot of flexibility, even if it comes
with some upfront maintenance cost. In fact, Matt wrote a great article on how
he <a href="https://therealmjp.github.io/posts/hello-hugo/">switched from WordPress to
Hugo</a>, which enlightened me to
some great solutions for more advanced features like comment hosting, which made
Hugo also seem like the best long-term option.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! Hopefully I stick with this whole blogging thing, but in case I
don&rsquo;t, there are plenty of folks who do just fine in filling the void of 1s and
0s that is the internet &ndash; like those mentioned above!</p>

      <description>Something that I find intimidating about game programming blogs is when they&amp;rsquo;re by folks who are veterans of the industry, working in some impressive lead position with numerous publications/presentations to their name, but they just have a one-liner describing their career.

I&amp;rsquo;m nowhere close to being as impressive as these folks, but I am writing a blog, so I figured I should be the change I want to see in the world and talk a bit about my history as a graphics programmer.</description>

<p>I&rsquo;m nowhere close to being as impressive as these folks, but I <em>am</em> writing a

bit about my history as a graphics programmer. This page is structured in

<figure class="banner"><img src="/work/Crytek.jpeg"
    alt="Crytek poster with various IPs">
</figure>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently working for <a href="http://crytek.com/">Crytek</a> in Frankfurt, Germany, as
a rendering engineer on CryEngine. I was very happy with my work and team at my
previous job, but I knew that I eventually needed to make a foray into the games
industry on the principle of treading the same ground as some of my heroes. I
also knew that a lot of the graphics work I&rsquo;ve done so far was specialized for
the projects themselves, and so I needed to go somewhere where I could properly
learn the ropes for graphics in games.</p>
<p>In that regard, I appreciate being given the opportunity by the rendering team
at Crytek, and I hope to bring at least a couple things of value from my prior
experience. During the interview process, my weakest area was certainly my lack
of experience in implementing any state-of-the-art games research, so I
recommend others who are similarly looking to do graphics in the games industry
to spend time reading papers/presentations and try to implement one or two of
them.</p>
<p>As for why I moved to Germany&hellip; I determined that I was at a point in my life
where I had nothing tying me down, and that wouldn&rsquo;t always be the case. So I
figured that now might be my only opportunity to try working outside of the good
ol&rsquo; U. S. of A. I didn&rsquo;t have anywhere in particular in mind, though, so moving
to Germany specifically was more of a luck-of-the-draw with my job hunting. One
plus for Germany is that it&rsquo;s known for having a strong work-life balance, and
I&rsquo;m interested in seeing how that fits me?</p>

<figure class="banner"><img src="/work/AppleVisionPro.webp"
    alt="Apple Vision Pro ad">

<p>I worked for Apple for almost exactly 4.5 years on
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/">RealityKit</a>, the
rendering and simulation framework that drives the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision
Pro</a>. I joined in July 2019 and left in
January 2024, just before it launched. During my time there, I got to touch a
wide variety of tech, including frame graph rendering, advanced transparency
handling, novel mixed-reality shadowing algorithms, and more. I feel immensely
blessed to have worked on such an interesting project with such a great team,
and landing the job was probably a nice blend of things coming together: My
AR/VR experience from <a href="#entertainment-technology-center%22">graduate school</a>, my
proprierty engine experience on <a href="#isetta-engine">Isetta</a>, my graphics focus in
<a href="#college">undergrad</a>, and my experience in working with artists from
<a href="#anthem">Anthem</a>. (I still studied the heck out of the rendering equation,
though!)</p>
<h2 id="facebook-reality-labs">Facebook Reality Labs</h2>
<figure class="banner"><img src="/work/CodecAvatars.gif"
    alt="Animation of the Codec Avatars circa 2019">
</figure>

<p>For my last semester of grad school, I did a work semester. Through a professor
I had in a production course from the previous year, I got a four month contract
working for Facebook (now Meta) in their Reality Lab in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. There, I did generalist graphics and systems programming in
support of all of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-oculus-codec-avatars-vr/">super cool &ldquo;Codec Avatar&rdquo;
tech</a> that the
researchers were building. There was practically no process for landing the job
&ndash; it was largely based on word-of-mouth from my professor and one behavioral
interview with him (because he was also working as the general manager of the
lab!), which goes to show that &ldquo;who you know&rdquo; is still as alive and well as
ever.</p>
<h2 id="isetta-engine">Isetta Engine</h2>
<figure class="banner"><a href="https://isetta.io/interviews/"><img src="/work/BehindTheBlackBox.png"
    alt="Behind the Black Box published cover"></a>
</figure>

<p>Probably my most formative project from grad school was <a href="https://isetta.io">Isetta
Engine</a>, a three-month marathon of building a game engine in
C++. It was super exhausting and had a huge scope, no doubt also due to the fact
that since most of our faculty was design and art focused, we had to cater the
project to them with promises of documentation, blogs, interviews, and even
publishing a book and making a documentary! But the team and I learned a ton not
just because of the work we did, but also all of the wisdom shared with us by
industry veterans. This was my second student pitch project (the first being
<a href="#music-in-motion"><em>Music in Motion</em></a>), so I had some experience with placating
the faculty into endorsing our project, but it was still eye-opening to see how
effectively we could sell our ideal project by emphasizing some of the less
conventional deliverables, like the blog.</p>

<h2 id="anthem">Anthem</h2>
<figure class="banner"><img src="/work/Anthem.jpg"
    alt="Anthem marketing image from EA">
</figure>

<p>Over the summer of 2018, I worked an internship with BioWare on their upcoming
IP <em>Anthem</em>. The role was actually as a technical artist, so I supported the art
team with Maya tools written in Maya Embedded Language (blegh) as well as my
&ldquo;capstone&rdquo; project, an icon generation tool to automate a painfully lengthy
authoring process the UI designers and artist were using. Getting exposure to
EA&rsquo;s Frostbite engine and building tools to address the team&rsquo;s pain points were
both valuable experiences for my future career, for which I&rsquo;m glad I took the
chance on a technical art position. As for how I got the internship in the first
place, it was just a typical &ldquo;job hunt&rdquo; grind &ndash; I think my prior classroom
experience with graphis helped a lot with getting the offer.</p>
<h2 id="music-in-motion">Music in Motion</h2>
<figure class="banner"><img src="/work/MusicInMotion.png"
    alt="Screenshot from colorful blobby VR experience">
</figure>

<p>My first long-term project in grad school was <em>Music in Motion</em>, a trippy VR
experience whose goal was to drive the visual experience from music that the
player would generate. It started much more ambitious as a &ldquo;tactile&rdquo; method of
learning how synthesizers worked, and the core tech was still very much based on
that with leveraging <a href="https://supercollider.github.io/">SuperCollider</a>
networking with Unity to process the movements and actions from the player and
turn them into generative audio, but after a troubling showing at the halfway
point in the project, we decided that a creative experience a la <a href="https://likelike.org/">LIKELIKE
Arcade</a> would suit our work better. We even integrated
hardware into the experience with programmatically-driven colored lighting built
into some steel stanchions that doubled as a 12-speaker surround sound setup &ndash;
obviously the person wearing the VR headset wouldn&rsquo;t be able to appreciate it
fully, but it was a treat for the spectators!</p>
<p>This project was one of the rare &ldquo;student pitched&rdquo; projects at a program where
most of the projects were faculty- or client-sourced, and we definitely put a
ton of effort into getting picked. Our demo was an amalgam of distinct cool
technologies like metaball rendering in VR, realtime synthesizer playing on a
laptop, and a workout rubber band for emulating the physical experiences we
wanted to translate into music! The pitch was a valuable experience in creative
problem solving, if nothing else.</p>
<p>This type of thing is best experienced in motion, so if you&rsquo;re curious about it,
check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mn29VT9tpuw">our trailer</a> or the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au1gkM4lRRs">final demo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="entertainment-technology-center">Entertainment Technology Center</h2>
<figure class="banner"><img src="/work/BVW2017.jpg"
    alt="Photo of the CMU ETC building">
</figure>

<p>In 2017, I entered the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) at Carnegie Mellon
University. This was a program I had been interested in since high school
because it was effectively a &ldquo;video games&rdquo; program at a renowned university, but
thankfully it ended up being much better than that. Started in the 90s by the
late <a href="https://www.etc.cmu.edu/lastlecture10/">Randy Pausch</a>, the coursework
always focused heavily on how technology can make things &ldquo;fun&rdquo;, which of course
means video games, but also included location-based entertainment, VR,
wearables, and the like. It was also very project-focused instead of
theoretical; in the first semester, all of the students build five games with
roughly two weeks each.</p>
<p>The ETC was a fantastic learning environment where so many of the students are
driven primarily by passion and creativity, and its heavily cross-disciplinary
nature exposed me to how to work in a diverse team. My prior graphics classroom
experience paired with my time with <a href="#college">the VGDC and LATIS in college</a>
are probably what got me into the school, and my projects from the first
semester let me work with the Vive, HoloLens, ARKit, and a cool custom
&ldquo;controller&rdquo; called the <a href="https://www.jamodrum.net/">Jam-o-Drum</a>.</p>
<p>The wonderful design above is by Fangda Luo and Yvette Han &ndash; they managed to
insert characters from games by literally every student in our class on it!
(Mine is the evil-looking snowman coming out of the 0, in case you were
wondering)</p>
<h2 id="college">College</h2>
<figure class="banner"><img src="/work/College.PNG"
    alt="Collection of rendered images from college work">
</figure>

<p>I attended a state university for college (wasn&rsquo;t quite able to get into the
swanky Ivy League level schools &ndash; all&rsquo;s well that ends well, because I paid a
lot less going to a public school!). The starting computer science curriculum
was pretty generic with classes on algorithms and data structures, operating
systems, AI, dynamic programming, C++, etc. But thankfully, the school&rsquo;s
computer science program was large enough to have specialized tracks after your
first year, where I chose the &ldquo;graphics and visualization&rdquo; track. This is where
I was exposed to the more interesting courses, like physical animation and
motion planning, raytracing, and fundamentals of graphics. The images in the
banner are some of my work from those classes.</p>
<p>There were two other notable experiences from my time in college that impacted
my career: the <a href="https://vgdc.club/">Video Game Development Club</a> (VGDC) and the
<a href="https://latislearning.umn.edu/about">Emerging Technology and Creativity Lab at the Liberal Arts
college</a> (LATIS ETC). The VGDC was less
productive for me on a technical level than it should&rsquo;ve been because I was
often paralyzed by imposter syndrome, but despite that, I managed to get elected
as president of the club and I learned many lessons on running an organization
of creative folks. LATIS was a precursor of my later
<a href="#entertainment-technology-center">&ldquo;ETC&rdquo;</a> experience, where I cut my teeth with a
handful of &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; technologies like VR.</p>
<h2 id="high-school">High School</h2>
<figure class="banner"><img src="/work/Gamemaker.jpg"
    alt="GameMaker: Studio">
</figure>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t exposed to computer programming until my last semester of high school.
I did have some experience with modding tools for games, which I used to do
things like create custom characters in <em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</em>, but no
programming was involved.</p>
<p>I tried to learn programming by reading the <em>C++ Primer</em> from
Pearson, but that was simultaneously overwhelming and boring (in hindsight, I
definitely should have looked for Python projects to start with). My real
introduction to programming was in GameMaker Studio, which we used as part of a
game development class that was offered for the first time my senior year of
high school. The class itself didn&rsquo;t require any programming, but I always found
myself ahead of the assignments, so I tried reimplementing them in GML to see if
I could do anything more interesting &ndash; and the rest was history!</p>
<h1 id="end-beginning">The End/Beginning</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! Hopefully this is useful to any bright-eyed greenhorn who wanders
onto my website, or even to my experienced peers should people be feeling
imposter syndrome. If you&rsquo;re curious about any particulars from my work
experience, feel free to shoot me an email at
<a href="mailto:mail@cbias.co">mail@cbias.co</a>. Just bear in mind that
NDA topics will stay NDA, I&rsquo;m not eager to burn any bridges (or garner lawsuits)
at the moment!</p>
