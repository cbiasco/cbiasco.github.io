      <description>This is probably my first real post to any blog anywhere! I wanted to keep it short and sweet, but I tend to go a little overboard when it comes to writing, so please bear with me (this pun made more sense when I thought I&amp;rsquo;d use Bear Blog for my host!).
I&amp;rsquo;m a graphics engineer who has spent most of his career in tech so far, where I had the convenient (but totally illegitimate) excuse of &amp;ldquo;the company doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow its employees to publish personal software projects online&amp;rdquo; to procrastinate on anything non-work related.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is probably my first real post to any blog anywhere! I wanted to keep it
short and sweet, but I tend to go a little overboard when it comes to writing,
so please bear with me (this pun made more sense when I thought I&rsquo;d use <a href="https://bearblog.dev">Bear
Blog</a> for my host!).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a graphics engineer who has spent most of his career in tech so far, where I
had the convenient (but totally illegitimate) excuse of &ldquo;the company doesn&rsquo;t
allow its employees to publish personal software projects online&rdquo; to
procrastinate on anything non-work related. But I recently made a big career
change over to the games industry, and I figured that now is a better time than
ever to break my laziness streak! So I hope to mostly talk about code projects
here, probably related to graphics and games, but one of the best parts of doing
something new is that you can go in any direction, and it will still feel new,
so who knows how this will turn out!</p>

<p>For this first post, I just want to talk about my process for picking a blog
host. <a href="https://calebbiasco.com">I already have a (soon-to-be-deprecated)
website</a>, but it was built for job hunting and with
much less of a minimalist streak than I have now, which is why I&rsquo;m looking for
greener pastures. Now, I&rsquo;m the type of person to indulge in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">&ldquo;analysis
paralysis&rdquo;</a> when it comes to
any decision that involves any sort of commitment whatsoever, so it should come
as no surprise that I opened about 20 tabs worth of webpages as soon as I
decided I wanted to write a blog. With my main interest being graphics, I&rsquo;ll
want a good way to integrate images, videos, and code into the posts, but as
with most software, the world is really our oyster when it comes to what&rsquo;s
possible.</p>
<p>I obviously didn&rsquo;t invent the idea of blogging about graphics stuff, so I
decided to take a look at a few examples that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed over the years to see
if any features from their websites stood out:</p>
<h2 id="bear-bloghttpsbearblogdev"><a href="https://bearblog.dev">Bear Blog</a></h2>
<p>Bear Blog is a super simplified blog host that focuses on its consistency and
robustness over feature richness or monetization. On top of that, Bear Blog has
qualities that made it a great &ldquo;low-commitment&rdquo; choice: it&rsquo;s free-ish and is
super easy to set up, it has all of the basic building blocks for cutting one&rsquo;s
teeth on blog writing, and it seems to follow some tenets that I personally
endorse, such as <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/building-software-to-last-forever/">building long-lasting
software</a>.</p>
<p>I actually gave this a try before going with my current host, mainly because of
the &ldquo;analysis paralysis&rdquo; topic. Of all of the things that I&rsquo;ve learned so far in
my career, one of the most important is the truth behind the word &ldquo;commitment&rdquo;.
There are times when committing to something legitimately deserves great
caution, but those things tend to be a bit obvious &ndash; for example, a work
contract. In 99% of the non-obvious cases though, the amount of effort needed to
undo a commitment is so low that it&rsquo;s not worth more than a minute of thought,
and &ldquo;which blog service should I use&rdquo; for sure fits into that bucket. And given
that I switched to another option within a week of choosing it, I&rsquo;d say that
wasn&rsquo;t a bad idea!</p>
<h2 id="the-ryg-blog-fabian-giesenhttpsfgiesenwordpresscom"><a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com">The ryg blog (Fabian Giesen)</a></h2>
<p>Fabian uses <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>, one of the old hats when it
comes to web hosting. I had the experience of working in WordPress about a
decade ago, and while I&rsquo;ll always be impressed by the sheer technical depth that
Fabian puts into his posts, I imagine he may still be dealing with the WYSIWYG
clunkiness that software from WordPress&rsquo;s era tends to carry with them. Aside
from that, it also has a pretty busy layout, and I&rsquo;m interested in being as
lightweight and to the point as I can manage.</p>
<h2 id="inigo-quilezs-bloghttpsiquilezlesorg"><a href="https://iquilezles.org">Inigo Quilez&rsquo;s blog</a></h2>
<p>Since Inigo has been a staple resource for graphics on the web for many years, I
imagine that his site has organically grown into what it is today. Considering
that it&rsquo;s more of an encyclopedia than a blog at this point, it makes sense that
it would be very customized (although aside from embedded
<a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">ShaderToy</a> programs, it&rsquo;s mostly just images and
Markdown). But my priorities are in getting my thoughts down on digital paper
and pushed out into the world, so I imagine I won&rsquo;t need the level of usability
that Inigo&rsquo;s site strives for.</p>
<h2 id="bartosz-ciechanowskis-bloghttpsciechanowski"><a href="https://ciechanow.ski/">Bartosz Ciechanowski&rsquo;s blog</a></h2>
<p>On the surface, Bartosz&rsquo;s website seems a little more cookie cutter than
Inigo&rsquo;s, looking like something you could get from any blog service. But as soon
as you dig into any of his posts, it&rsquo;s obvious that it may be the most high-tech
blog in existence! Even beyond the highly interactive and beautiful renderings,
his text styling and how it matches the illustrations is *<em>chef&rsquo;s kiss</em>*. I
frankly might send him an email just to ask if he uses any tools for
constructing his blog posts, or if it&rsquo;s by hand&hellip; In any case, while this feels
like a gold standard to aspire to, I also recognize that it requires an
extraordinary amount of experience and design expertise, so I think it&rsquo;s in my
better interest to opt for a more constrained blog service. At least for now.</p>
<h2 id="the-danger-zone-matt-pettineohttpstherealmjpgithubio"><a href="https://therealmjp.github.io/">The Danger Zone (Matt Pettineo)</a></h2>
<p>Matt uses a self-hosted <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> instance, with the
<a href="https://github.com/Track3/hermit">Hermit</a> style. The result is a super clean
and pretty lightweight site that is as customizable as anything else on the web,
even including <a href="https://therealmjp.github.io/posts/gpu-memory-pool/#cpu-write-performance">embedded
JavaScript</a>.
It also includes comments, which can be great for extending the discussion on
topics. However, a peek behind the curtain at his hosting repo reminded me of
exactly why I grew to dislike hosting my own website: CSS, yaml, doc generators,
HTML&hellip; But my previous experience with maintaining a self-hosted website may
allow me to avoid the biggest pitfalls with this option.</p>
<p>There were a couple others that I took a look at (<a href="https://www.jeremyong.com">Jeremy
Ong</a>, <a href="https://bartwronski.com">Bart Wronski</a>), but
they were mostly just different flavors of one of the options I listed above.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-went-with">What I went with</h2>
<p>If you happen to just read the footer of my website (unless I&rsquo;ve since changed
it), you&rsquo;ll notice that I went with Hugo. Ultimately, Bear Blog was just a bit
too limiting in its design for me, and the fact that I&rsquo;d have to pay a few bucks
to remove those limitations made it a bit more of a &ldquo;commitment&rdquo; in a sense.
Hugo, on the other hand, clearly shows a lot of flexibility, even if it comes
with some upfront maintenance cost. In fact, Matt wrote a great article on how
he <a href="https://therealmjp.github.io/posts/hello-hugo/">switched from WordPress to
Hugo</a>, which enlightened me to
some great solutions for more advanced features like comment hosting, which made
Hugo also seem like the best long-term option.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! Hopefully I stick with this whole blogging thing, but in case I
don&rsquo;t, there are plenty of folks who do just fine in filling the void of 1s and
0s that is the internet &ndash; like those mentioned above!</p>

<p>Mostly just still settling in Germany after moving here from California. I mean, I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;settled in&rdquo;, but now I&rsquo;ve gotten to the part where I actually have to do interesting things with my time, and that&rsquo;s the part that always stumps me&hellip;</p>
<p>Apart from that, I&rsquo;m obviously giving this whole blogging thing a try! The pessimist in me knows that it will only entertain me for a week or two before I find a convenient excuse to shirk the whole thing off, but the optimist in me likes to smile blankly and let things go in one ear and out the other. Who knows who will win!</p>
