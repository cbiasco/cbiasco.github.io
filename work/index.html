    <p>Something that I find intimidating about game programming blogs is when they&rsquo;re
by folks who are veterans of the industry, working in some impressive lead
position with numerous publications/presentations to their name, but they just
have a one-liner describing their career. My imagination runs rampant wondering
how they got to where they are!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nowhere close to being as impressive as these folks, but I <em>am</em> writing a
blog, so I figured I should be the change I want to see in the world and talk a
bit about my history as a graphics programmer. This page is structured in
reverse-chronological order, so when I update it, my most recent career news
will be at the top. If you want to jump to my baby years, scroll to the bottom

<p>I&rsquo;m currently working for <a href="http://crytek.com/">Crytek</a> in Frankfurt, Germany, as
a rendering engineer on CryEngine. I was very happy with my work and team at my
previous job, but I knew that I eventually needed to make a foray into the games
industry on the principle of treading the same ground as some of my heroes. I
also knew that a lot of the graphics work I&rsquo;ve done so far was specialized for
the projects themselves, and so I needed to go somewhere where I could properly
learn the ropes for graphics in games.</p>
<p>In that regard, I appreciate being given the opportunity by the rendering team
at Crytek, and I hope to bring at least a couple things of value from my prior
experience. During the interview process, my weakest area was certainly my lack
of experience in implementing any state-of-the-art games research, so I
recommend others who are similarly looking to do graphics in the games industry
to spend time reading papers/presentations and try to implement one or two of
them.</p>
<p>As for why I moved to Germany&hellip; I determined that I was at a point in my life
where I had nothing tying me down, and that wouldn&rsquo;t always be the case. So I
figured that now might be my only opportunity to try working outside of the good
ol&rsquo; U. S. of A. I didn&rsquo;t have anywhere in particular in mind, though, so moving
to Germany specifically was more of a luck-of-the-draw with my job hunting. One
plus for Germany is that it&rsquo;s known for having a strong work-life balance, and
I&rsquo;m interested in seeing how that fits me?</p>

<p>I worked for Apple for almost exactly 4.5 years on
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/">RealityKit</a>, the
rendering and simulation framework that drives the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision
Pro</a>. I joined in July 2019 and left in
January 2024, just before it launched. During my time there, I got to touch a
wide variety of tech, including frame graph rendering, advanced transparency
handling, novel mixed-reality shadowing algorithms, and more. I feel immensely
blessed to have worked on such an interesting project with such a great team,
and landing the job was probably a nice blend of things coming together: My
AR/VR experience from <a href="#entertainment-technology-center%22">graduate school</a>, my
proprierty engine experience on <a href="#isetta-engine">Isetta</a>, my graphics focus in
<a href="#college">undergrad</a>, and my experience in working with artists from
<a href="#anthem">Anthem</a>. (I still studied the heck out of the rendering equation,
though!)</p>
<h2 id="facebook-reality-labs">Facebook Reality Labs</h2>
<figure class="banner"><img src="/work/CodecAvatars.gif"

<p>For my last semester of grad school, I did a work semester. Through a professor
I had in a production course from the previous year, I got a four month contract
working for Facebook (now Meta) in their Reality Lab in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. There, I did generalist graphics and systems programming in
support of all of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-oculus-codec-avatars-vr/">super cool &ldquo;Codec Avatar&rdquo;
tech</a> that the
researchers were building. There was practically no process for landing the job
&ndash; it was largely based on word-of-mouth from my professor and one behavioral
interview with him (because he was also working as the general manager of the
lab!), which goes to show that &ldquo;who you know&rdquo; is still as alive and well as
ever.</p>
<h2 id="isetta-engine">Isetta Engine</h2>
<figure class="banner"><a href="https://isetta.io/interviews/"><img src="/work/BehindTheBlackBox.png"
    alt="Behind the Black Box published cover"></a>
</figure>

<p>Probably my most formative project from grad school was <a href="https://isetta.io">Isetta
Engine</a>, a three-month marathon of building a game engine in
C++. It was super exhausting and had a huge scope, no doubt also due to the fact
that since most of our faculty was design and art focused, we had to cater the
project to them with promises of documentation, blogs, interviews, and even
publishing a book and making a documentary! But the team and I learned a ton not
just because of the work we did, but also all of the wisdom shared with us by
industry veterans. This was my second student pitch project (the first being
<a href="#music-in-motion"><em>Music in Motion</em></a>), so I had some experience with placating
the faculty into endorsing our project, but it was still eye-opening to see how
effectively we could sell our ideal project by emphasizing some of the less
conventional deliverables, like the blog.</p>

<h2 id="anthem">Anthem</h2>
<figure class="banner"><img src="/work/Anthem.jpg"
    alt="Anthem marketing image from EA">
</figure>

<p>Over the summer of 2018, I worked an internship with BioWare on their upcoming
IP <em>Anthem</em>. The role was actually as a technical artist, so I supported the art
team with Maya tools written in Maya Embedded Language (blegh) as well as my
&ldquo;capstone&rdquo; project, an icon generation tool to automate a painfully lengthy
authoring process the UI designers and artist were using. Getting exposure to
EA&rsquo;s Frostbite engine and building tools to address the team&rsquo;s pain points were
both valuable experiences for my future career, for which I&rsquo;m glad I took the
chance on a technical art position. As for how I got the internship in the first
place, it was just a typical &ldquo;job hunt&rdquo; grind &ndash; I think my prior classroom
experience with graphis helped a lot with getting the offer.</p>
<h2 id="music-in-motion">Music in Motion</h2>
<figure class="banner"><img src="/work/MusicInMotion.png"
    alt="Screenshot from colorful blobby VR experience">
</figure>

<p>My first long-term project in grad school was <em>Music in Motion</em>, a trippy VR
experience whose goal was to drive the visual experience from music that the
player would generate. It started much more ambitious as a &ldquo;tactile&rdquo; method of
learning how synthesizers worked, and the core tech was still very much based on
that with leveraging <a href="https://supercollider.github.io/">SuperCollider</a>
networking with Unity to process the movements and actions from the player and
turn them into generative audio, but after a troubling showing at the halfway
point in the project, we decided that a creative experience a la <a href="https://likelike.org/">LIKELIKE
Arcade</a> would suit our work better. We even integrated
hardware into the experience with programmatically-driven colored lighting built
into some steel stanchions that doubled as a 12-speaker surround sound setup &ndash;
obviously the person wearing the VR headset wouldn&rsquo;t be able to appreciate it
fully, but it was a treat for the spectators!</p>
<p>This project was one of the rare &ldquo;student pitched&rdquo; projects at a program where
most of the projects were faculty- or client-sourced, and we definitely put a
ton of effort into getting picked. Our demo was an amalgam of distinct cool
technologies like metaball rendering in VR, realtime synthesizer playing on a
laptop, and a workout rubber band for emulating the physical experiences we
wanted to translate into music! The pitch was a valuable experience in creative
problem solving, if nothing else.</p>
<p>This type of thing is best experienced in motion, so if you&rsquo;re curious about it,
check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mn29VT9tpuw">our trailer</a> or the

<h2 id="entertainment-technology-center">Entertainment Technology Center</h2>
<figure class="banner"><img src="/work/BVW2017.jpg"
    alt="Photo of the CMU ETC building">
</figure>

<p>In 2017, I entered the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) at Carnegie Mellon
University. This was a program I had been interested in since high school
because it was effectively a &ldquo;video games&rdquo; program at a renowned university, but
thankfully it ended up being much better than that. Started in the 90s by the
late <a href="https://www.etc.cmu.edu/lastlecture10/">Randy Pausch</a>, the coursework
always focused heavily on how technology can make things &ldquo;fun&rdquo;, which of course
means video games, but also included location-based entertainment, VR,
wearables, and the like. It was also very project-focused instead of
theoretical; in the first semester, all of the students build five games with
roughly two weeks each.</p>
<p>The ETC was a fantastic learning environment where so many of the students are
driven primarily by passion and creativity, and its heavily cross-disciplinary
nature exposed me to how to work in a diverse team. My prior graphics classroom
experience paired with my time with <a href="#college">the VGDC and LATIS in college</a>
are probably what got me into the school, and my projects from the first
semester let me work with the Vive, HoloLens, ARKit, and a cool custom
&ldquo;controller&rdquo; called the <a href="https://www.jamodrum.net/">Jam-o-Drum</a>.</p>
<p>The wonderful design above is by Fangda Luo and Yvette Han &ndash; they managed to
insert characters from games by literally every student in our class on it!
(Mine is the evil-looking snowman coming out of the 0, in case you were
wondering)</p>
<h2 id="college">College</h2>
<figure class="banner"><img src="/work/College.PNG"
    alt="Collection of rendered images from college work">
</figure>

<p>I attended a state university for college (wasn&rsquo;t quite able to get into the
swanky Ivy League level schools &ndash; all&rsquo;s well that ends well, because I paid a
lot less going to a public school!). The starting computer science curriculum
was pretty generic with classes on algorithms and data structures, operating
systems, AI, dynamic programming, C++, etc. But thankfully, the school&rsquo;s
computer science program was large enough to have specialized tracks after your
first year, where I chose the &ldquo;graphics and visualization&rdquo; track. This is where
I was exposed to the more interesting courses, like physical animation and
motion planning, raytracing, and fundamentals of graphics. The images in the
banner are some of my work from those classes.</p>
<p>There were two other notable experiences from my time in college that impacted
my career: the <a href="https://vgdc.club/">Video Game Development Club</a> (VGDC) and the
<a href="https://latislearning.umn.edu/about">Emerging Technology and Creativity Lab at the Liberal Arts
college</a> (LATIS ETC). The VGDC was less
productive for me on a technical level than it should&rsquo;ve been because I was
often paralyzed by imposter syndrome, but despite that, I managed to get elected
as president of the club and I learned many lessons on running an organization
of creative folks. LATIS was a precursor of my later
<a href="#entertainment-technology-center">&ldquo;ETC&rdquo;</a> experience, where I cut my teeth with a
handful of &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; technologies like VR.</p>
<h2 id="high-school">High School</h2>
<figure class="banner"><img src="/work/Gamemaker.jpg"
    alt="GameMaker: Studio">
</figure>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t exposed to computer programming until my last semester of high school.
I did have some experience with modding tools for games, which I used to do
things like create custom characters in <em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</em>, but no
programming was involved.</p>
<p>I tried to learn programming by reading the <em>C++ Primer</em> from
Pearson, but that was simultaneously overwhelming and boring (in hindsight, I
definitely should have looked for Python projects to start with). My real
introduction to programming was in GameMaker Studio, which we used as part of a
game development class that was offered for the first time my senior year of
high school. The class itself didn&rsquo;t require any programming, but I always found
myself ahead of the assignments, so I tried reimplementing them in GML to see if
I could do anything more interesting &ndash; and the rest was history!</p>
<h1 id="end-beginning">The End/Beginning</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! Hopefully this is useful to any bright-eyed greenhorn who wanders
onto my website, or even to my experienced peers should people be feeling
imposter syndrome. If you&rsquo;re curious about any particulars from my work
experience, feel free to shoot me an email at
<a href="mailto:mail@cbias.co">mail@cbias.co</a>. Just bear in mind that
NDA topics will stay NDA, I&rsquo;m not eager to burn any bridges (or garner lawsuits)
at the moment!</p>
