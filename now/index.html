<p>Mostly just still settling in Germany after moving here from California. I mean,
I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;settled in&rdquo;, but now I&rsquo;ve gotten to the part where I actually have to do
interesting things with my time, and that&rsquo;s the part that always stumps me&hellip;</p>
<p>Apart from that, I&rsquo;m obviously giving this whole blogging thing a try! The
pessimist in me knows that it will only entertain me for a week or two before I
find a convenient excuse to shirk the whole thing off, but the optimist in me
likes to smile blankly and let things go in one ear and out the other. Who knows
who will win!</p>
